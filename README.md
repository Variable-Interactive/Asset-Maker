# Asset-Maker
<h2>
Hello Everyone!!!</h2>
<p class="text-center">
  This program is a voxel painter ( i-e. block based 3d modeller) that i  made using Godot. It can be used to make simple assets and then export them to wavefront(.obj) format which can be imported into blender or a  Game Engine.</p>

<h4>Floor/Layers:</h4>
<p>&nbsp; Value (-1 to 100)<br>
    &nbsp; The value of Floor/Layer determines the height of placement of block using shortcut key (Page Up,Page Down) you can increase or decrease the layer by "1" (if you want more precision, you can manually set it in its field box, there you can set it as a multiple of "0.1" (The coordinate system is according to how it is done in <b>Blender</b> therefore when layer value is changed by, it will appear to be changed by Half)</p>
<h4>Tools:</h4>
<p> &nbsp; You can set them in the "Options tab" </p>
<h5>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.&nbsp;  Draw Tool:</h5>
